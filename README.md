# gymStarterPack
This webpage provides a comprehensive Gym Starter Pack designed to guide beginners on their fitness journey. It covers essential gym gear, nutrition basics, beginner-friendly exercises, and practical tips for newcomers. The rationale behind this page is to offer an accessible resource that simplifies the often overwhelming process of starting a fitness routine. By focusing on fundamental equipment, nutritional advice, and effective exercises, users are empowered with the knowledge needed to begin their fitness journey confidently. The clean layout ensures easy navigation, helping users quickly find the information they need to start building healthier habits. Prior to the implementation of this website, I have never done any web design work before and this is my first time using HTML and CSS, and now I feel confident in my abilities to build websites using HTML.
